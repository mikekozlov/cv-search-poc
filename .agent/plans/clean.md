# Add email notifications when order status changes

This ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds.

This ExecPlan must be maintained in accordance with .agent/PLANS.md.

## Purpose / Big Picture

After this change, when an order’s status is updated (e.g. from "Processing" to "Shipped"), the system sends an email notification to the customer. We can demonstrate this by placing a test order in the staging environment and changing its status via the admin UI or API.

## Progress

- [ ] (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mmZ) Initial plan drafted.
- [ ] Discover existing order lifecycle and notification infrastructure.
- [ ] Implement email notification trigger.
- [ ] Add tests and validation steps.
- [ ] Run acceptance tests in staging.
